Project Overview:

	I will be programming a video game engine from scratch. It will be a very simplified version of existing game engines such as Unity. I plan to code this in C++ because it is a language Iâ€™d like to gain familiarity with. However, if this proves to be too difficult, I will do it in C# instead as I have much more experience with this. I intend to gain a deeper understanding of game engines through this project. I plan to break into the game development industry after graduating, and I believe that educating myself on how game engines work through making one from scratch will greatly benefit me. I will need to learn how to render objects with computer graphics, manipulate them with physics components, make a user-friendly UI, and ultimately create a tool that is capable of running a basic gameplay loop.
